# Print-Queue-Simulation
Printer Queue Simulation program

This is a program that uses queue to simulate multiple print servers.
User inputs the number of printers in the range of 1 - 6. User inputs the mean print size in the range of 1 - 150 pages. User inputs the duration of simulation from 1 - 1000 minutes. User inputs the mean arrival time between print jobs from 1 - 30.

If user does not input data into text field the program will input the minimum data parameter for user. Current minimums are: Minimum mean job size: 1 Minimum job simulation duration: 1 Minimum interval between jobs: 1

As the simulation runs current queue information is displayed: In a queue data tab Server statistics are updated dynamically in server statistics are updated dynamically in server statistics tab System summaary is available in the system summary tab User can save or print simulation.
